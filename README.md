# General info
The first application based on SCRUM methodology and JavaScript technology created by: Piotr Sitarek, Edyta Pawelska, Błażej Bałruszewicz. We had just 5 days to write this application. We made all the 'must have' tasks and a few 'should have'. I think that we have learned a lot during these days and we perform very well.

The assumptions of the application are:
* recipe creation
* creating nutrition plans
* creating and displaying a weekly nutrition plan
* keeping all data in localStorage

## Technologies
Project is created with: 
* HTML5
* CSS 3
* JavaScript
* localStorage
